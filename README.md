# AddInterfaceVSIX
A Visual Studio 2019 extension that lets you add an interface with one click 

You can find it by right clicking on the folder/project you want to add it to:
![add interface](https://github.com/gurrenm3/AddInterfaceVSIX/blob/master/add%20interface.png)

Clicking on the button will open this popup, where you can provide the name and choose whether or not to make it public. Finally, click add

![add interface name](https://github.com/gurrenm3/AddInterfaceVSIX/blob/master/Add%20Interface%20name.png)
